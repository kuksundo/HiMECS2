      If you don't wish to receive notifications like this again you have two
      options:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Turn off <strong>all checks</strong> for new compiler installations.
          Do this by ticking the <em>Don't show this again</em> check box below.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you change your mind later you can re-enable the checks from the 
          <em>Configure Compilers</em> dialogue box.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Turn notifications on or off on a <strong>per-compiler</strong> basis.
          You need to do this after you have closed this dialogue box, again by
          using the <em>Configure Compilers</em> dialogue box.
        </p>  
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For information about how to configure automatic detection of Delphi
      compilers see the <a

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> only Delphi compilers can be automatically
      registered with <em>CodeSnip</em>: this doesn't work with Free Pascal.
