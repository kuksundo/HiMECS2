About the Src/Res/Img/Branding directory
========================================

If you are creating a fork of CodeSnip, or a program based on it, the
CodeSnip license does not permit you to use the images in this directory
in such a project.

To assist with this problem, alternative versions of the above images
are provided in the `Src/Res/Img/AltBranding` directory.

For more information see:

*   `Src/Res/Img/AltBranding/README.txt`

*   `Build.html`, specifically the "Get the Source Code" sub-section and
    the "Conditions For Release of Modified Code" section.

*   `Docs/License.html` for full details of the license restrictions
    applying to files in this directory.
